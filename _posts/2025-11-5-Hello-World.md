# Welcome to the Net
And so, the very-highly-anticipated and even more highly delayed Isaiah's piece of the Internet takes its first breath. Here, you'll find a slice of every hobby and interest I have. I hope somewhere among the run-on sentences there is meaningful commentary, or at least something to laugh at.

My hobbies vary and stretch across a lot of things, some of which have little to do with each other, and I hope that by writing and consolidating all my thoughts here someone might find something that resonates or means something to them. There's a few different explanations for why I made this page to begin with, so we can move through that list over the broad topics.

## Writing
I love to write, and read, and do anything that involves literature or English studies. I'm not die-hard for it, but it's a big pass time. I find that these days (post high-school) I can't get myself to write in a capacity that feels authentic to me. I'm likely not a novelist, or poet, or journalist, but I have a desire to express myself through written language in elevated format. I can think for longer, edit, re-write, and position my opinions in a way that allows me to express the core of each my beliefs, thoughts, interests, etc. 

Through this new blog and website, I hope to spend more time writing and rewriting as a longer effort to return to more regular metacognition. If you've read Demon Slayer, consider this Tanjiro's practice of Total Concentration Breathing. 

## Learning
As much as I love to read and write, I love to learn. I consider myself an avid-learner, and I let my curiosity lead me to as many new places, topics, people, and ideas as I can find. I feel as though documenting my learning, my progress, and seeing my opinions change over time will give me (and anyone who reads more than one article) a stronger understanding of my character. 

## Technology
The final main point is simply that I love technology! I enjoy seeing things progress, especially as it relates to technology; however, with that said I do also consider myself what's been coined as a "digital minimalist"[^1]. As much as I enjoy seeing things progress, my love for technology and innovation also strongly intersects with my obsession with healthy productivity and workspace habits and systems. I spend way more time than needed working and testing different workflows processes, apps, organizational methods, schedules and time-blocking routines, and so on. I believe that technology is here to help serve the people, to lessen stress and struggle, and help make easier the most important part of our day-to-day lives: connecting with others. Whether it's an academic, corporate, or casual space you're working in I believe connecting and conversing with others is the key to whatever you're trying to get done. 

So, with that said I hope to use this site to review and comment on the things I've tried, what works for me, what doesn't, and whatever I think I'd like to try next.
